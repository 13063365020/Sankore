<h4>Assumptions</h4>

<p>The cards pass through a box and are transformed. The goal is to identify the operation done by the box using a minimum of cards.</p>

<p>The assumptions may be written on the whiteboard (outside the App).</p>

<p>To pass a card through the box, simply click on it.</p>

<p>The "Edit" button allows you to :</p>

	<li>set the number of cards that you want to use,</li>
	<li>set the cards before and after transformation.</li>
</ul>
